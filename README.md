# Nile

The Nile application is an e-commerce system selling products to customers. The main target was the development of a back-end solution made in the Flask framework[1] connected to both, SQL and NoSQL databases. More specifically, MySQL[2] was chosen for an SQL implementation, and MongoDB[3] for a NoSQL database implementation.

The project has in total twenty different API routes (5x CRUDs) pointing to two different databases (MongoDB, MySQL).
